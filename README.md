# Full simulation of CMOS beta- probe in Geant4

## HOW TO RUN:
```
cd build
cmake -DGeant4_DIR=$G4INSTALL ../
make
./exampleB1

./exampleB1 -AbsD -1 -Z 0.010 -Fil 0 -Source 8 -Sensor 2 -PixT 1.75 -NPrim 1000000
./exampleB1 -AbsD -1 -Z 0.445 -Fil 1 -Source 8 -Sensor 2 -PixT 1.75 -NPrim 1000000

```
### Source Choice:
1 - Pointlike Sr\
2 - Extended Sr\
3 - ExtY\
4 - Co60\
5 - Na22\
6 - Ba133\
7 - Cs137\
8 - Flat Ele 0-3MeV\
9 - Flat Gamma 0-1MeV\
10 - Na22 "nude" (PG)

### Sensor Choice:
1 - MT9V011\
2 - MT9V115\
3 - bare 60035 SiPm



## GEOMETRY (maybe no more so accurate)
- Extended  Source ending at Z=0
- Cu collimator on top of Sr source (toggleble)
- CMOS Detector starting at Z offset (Z distance is from source surface to possible resin in case of sensor 1, or up to the sensor in case of sensor 2, even if with filter)
- Sensor resin filter in contact with CMOS (towards source)
- Dummy volume for scoring purposes between source (or if present CU Collimator) and World to score what exits the primary generation
- "infinite" carrier volume behind CMOS to simulate mechanical support

## CHANGELOG
2017.12.1 by collamaf
- Try to fix problem of primary particles double counting by putting a check in Stepping Action. Seems to reduce by about ~9% the number of exiting particles (NoCudZ2 test)

2017.12.4 by collamaf
- Added reset of pass counter in stacking action. Seems to increase back of about another 5% the number of exiting particles. now we have about 96% of the beginning. Verified this should be the right approach.

2017.12.12 by collamaf
- Corrected z_resin:  no need to add 1mm of copper since distance is always from source top

2018.01.17 by collamaf
- Deep reorganization of DetConstr, much clearer now
- Code extended to both sensors smoothly (new argument to be passed by terminal, default sensor 1).
- Fixed ExtY source problem

2018.01.30 by collamaf
- Quite deep reorganization of output root file, cleaned a little in ordering and name (and updated readme)
- Changed "DOTA" to "ExtY" in output file naming

2018.04.23 by collamaf
- Now resin is always present in front of CMOS, if flag not selected made of air (useful for scoring)
- Added double crossing check also for particles entering CMOS

2018.04.26 by collamaf
- Added InCmosEnPrim to bring primary particle info to Riduzione and DataAnalysis

2018.05.7 by collamaf
- first implementation of storage of time of interection. Still not clear which time to save...
- Introduced possibility to simulate bare SiPm (assumed to be a particular version of CMOS detector): SensorChoice=3

2018.05.29 by collamaf
- Added dummy volume in front of CMOS (towards source) to score what enters it after some problem in case of space between the CMOS and the filter (like in sensor 2-115)
- Now in SteppingAction to score what enters CMOS we use the new Dummy volume
- Modified size of resin in case of sensor 2 (is larger than the active area), according to datasheet
- Fixed error in positioning of filter in case of sensor 1 (was after cmos)
- Fixed why filter in Sensor2 was not working.. the unit for density=4 was missing, chissa come interpretava lui...

2018.05.30 by collamaf
- Fixed an error in the positioning of the carrier behind CMOS
- Added as argument to pass the thickness of the absorber
- Added new parts from SimDaVinci (StackingAction: kill neutrinos and change in primary particle storing, fileName generated in main)
- Added as argument to pass material of absorber (1: Cu, 2:Al, 3:PVC)
- Now if run in vis mode the file root ends with xxxTEST not to overwrite important ones
- Now arguments are taken with labels, not necessary to give them all! If a macro is provided no visualization is init.. cool!

2018.06.01 by collamaf
- Added "QuickFlag" in main to automatically scale number of pixel if I want to visualize geometry
- ".dat" was missing after Primaries file
- Fixed problem with positioning of dummy after source (or possible absorber)
- Added QuickFlag to be passed as an argument to program to call for scaled down geometry
- Added structure to classify energy release due to e+/e-/gamma

2018.06.06 by collamaf
- Added scoring of what enters the filter (PreFilterEn/TrackN/Part) - THERE IS SOME PROBLEM! If made by hand empty the spectrum of particles hitting the filter changes... TO BE UNDERSTOOD

2018.07.25 by collamaf
- Added Co60 source {SourceChoice= 4}
- Whole sources volumes reorganisation
- Added Na, Ba and Cs sources {SourceChoice= 5, 6, 7}

2018.08.10 by collamaf
- Gamma sources have now 1mm diameter (active spot)
- Added possibility to pass "label" to filename from command line
- No more need for macros, now number of primaries is calculated from source activity
- Pixel thickness is now passed as argument

2018.09.17 by collamaf
- Finally working for efficiency!!!!

2019.05.08 by collamaf
- Addedd Source 10, Na22 "nude", so that the beta+ exits

2019.05.21 by collamaf
- README cleaning
